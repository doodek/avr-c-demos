# AVR-C-Demos
Projects on Microchip (Atmel) AVR micros, free to use

Most of this code has been written between 2016 and 2018, when I was starting my 
joutney with AVR MCUs. Some of it may be broken. Some may be written in a bad way. 
Some lacks description. I was just learning. So if you are learning too, looking for bugs or anything,
maybe my code can help you somehow.
 
Projects:
  * ADC_Servo_Joy - manipulating two servos (pan tilt) with a joystick on ATMega8A
  * ADC_first_example - LED is ON when voltage > (AVCC/2)
