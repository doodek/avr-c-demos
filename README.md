# AVR-C-Demos
Projects on Microchip (Atmel) AVR micros, free to use

Most of this code has been written between 2016 and 2018, when I was starting my 
joutney with AVR MCUs. Some of it may be broken. Some may be written in a bad way. 
Some lacks description. I was just learning. So if you are learning too, looking for bugs or anything,
maybe my code can help you somehow.
 
Projects:
	* ADC_PWM_joystick_servo - manipulating two servos (pan tilt) with a joystick module on ATMega8A
	* ADC_led_on - LED is ON when ADC input voltage greater than half AVCC/2 (ATMega8A)
	* ADC_PWM_pot_led_brightness: Control LED brightness with analog input voltage (potentiometer)
	* ADC_led_strip: Control 8 LEDs with 47HC595 shift register
	* ASM_led_on: Just set on an LED with Assembly code (ATMega328p)
	* ASM_led_timer: Toggling a LED with timer, Assembly (ATMega8/A)
	* TIMER_rca_video: attempt to display something on a TV With RCA plug (ATMega328p)
	* UART_PWM_BT_servo: Controlling a servo through bluetooth (UART) module (val 0-255)
	* lib_pin_definitions: Pin definitions for ATMega8a
	* TIMER_ISR_check: Interrupt demo
